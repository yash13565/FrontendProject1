     <p className='para1'>“What is a portfolio website?”.
     In short, an online portfolio is a website you create to show off your skills, experience, projects, and even your personality to potential clients and/or employers. 

There are tons of benefits to building your own portfolio website, including:
<ul className='para'>
<li>Increased visibility, credibility and authority in your industry
When someone searches your name in Google, your tech portfolio website appears at the top</li>
<li>Hiring managers and clients can find you, instead of you trying to find them.</li> 
</ul>
     </p>

     </section>
     <p className='para2'>Having a clear and concise online portfolio/resume design is important, no matter what. But if you’re more into design than development, it becomes even more significant. For example, if you’re a UX designer, you’ll want to make sure this is showcased by your website itself (the UX design should be on point).
